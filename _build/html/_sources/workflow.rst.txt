==================
Suggested Workflow
==================

-----------------
Code Repositories
-----------------

In GitHub, create a fork of the Service Workbench repo `awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws <https://github.com/awslabs/service-workbench-on-aws>`_.  Your fork may be either public or private. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a Local Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone your GitHub repo ``mylogin/service-workbench-on-aws`` to your local file system.  This will create a remote repo named ``origin``, pointing to your GitHub repo.

``git clone mygithub git@github.com:mylogin/service-workbench-on-aws.git``

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Branch and Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main branch of the repo is ``mainline``. Create another branch of the repo for your work.

``git checkout -b my-dev``

Perform your local edits and commit to your local dev branch, then when complete, merge with your main branch.

``git checkout mainline``
``git merge my-dev``

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sync with Upstream, Push to GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sync option 1: Sync locally**

You may define the original (AWS) repo as a second remote repository (conventionally named ``upstream``), and sync it to your local repo after you have merged your edits to your ``mainline`` branch.

``git remote add upstream https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-service-workbench-on-aws.git``
``git pull upstream mainline``

**Push to GitHub**

For either sync option, push your local repo to your GitHub repo

``git push origin mainline``

**Sync Option 2: Sync on GitHub**

With your code pushed to your repo in GitHub, sync the AWS code into your code by clicking **Fetch upstream** -> **Fetch and merge**
Your GitHub repo now holds the Service Workbench source code, including your edits, and up to date with the upstream repo.

--------------
CI-CD Pipeline
--------------

Optionally, you may enable the CI-CD pipeline to automatically redeploy Service Workbench upon each new commit to a designated branch of your GitHub repo.

The CI-CD pipeline will not deploy configuration files, since all configuration files are excluded from the git repo by the top-level ``.gitignore`` file.  Perform the initial Service Workbench installation from a deployment instance, before performing subsequent redeploys using the CI-CD pipeline.  Configuration changes are achieved by uploading edited configuration files to the relevant location in the ``artifacts`` bucket: e.g.: the main config file goes in the ``settings`` folder.

Read the files ``docs/docs/best_practices/cicd.md`` and ``main/cicd/README.md`` for an explanation of the two stages ``cicd-pipeline`` and ``cicd-source``.   Only ``cicd-pipeline`` is necessary to deploy Service Workbench directly from your GitHub repo; ``cicd-code`` creates another repository in CodeCommit.

The sequence to follow is:

* Create a config file in ``main/cicd/cicd-pipeline/config/settings/`` by copying ``example-github.yml`` and naming it ``<stage>.yml``.
* Edit the config file with the details of your GitHub repo.
    * The **awsProfile** value refers to the profile on the build instance used by CodeBuild; use the value ``awsProfile: default``.  
    * **IMPORTANT**: If you define the ``awsProfile`` value in the ``cicd-pipeline`` config file, you must **not** define the ``awsProfile`` value in the Service Workbench main configuration file (``main/config/settings/<stage.yml``).  Comment out this line.

Once configured, commits to the GitHub repo specified above will trigger a CodePipeline pipeline which will retrieve the code from GitHub, and deploy Service Workbench using a CodeBuild build project.  You will need to provide access to your GitHub repo using the **Connect to GitHub** mechanism within CodePipeline.
